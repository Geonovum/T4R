## LAB-STUDIO-ARENA-AGORA MODEL

### [LAB](#H2):
The Lab is the place of experimentation and pioneering. Most innovations start in a Lab situation. The Lab is a place of experimentation and exploration. In this place crucial decisions have to be made, some of which can not easily be changed at a later stage of deployment. Mistakes made in the Lab can have far reaching consequences further along the way. One of the most common mistakes in this place is postponing exposure to other stakeholders outside the Lab place in the early stages. 

*Typical Digital Twin Lab stakeholder conversations: among pioneers, technical experts, data scientists.*

### [STUDIO](#H3):
The Studio is the place of experimentation and pioneering where pioneers meet and exchange early progress, ideas and solutions. The Studio is a place of experimentation and exploration, but teaming up with others to accumulate lessons learned, discuss standards, adopt best practises from each Lab etc. If projects move from the Lab to the Studio space and mistakes have been made in each Lab in consulting other stakeholders outside the Lab place, complexities arise since the Studio place usually accelerates innovations towards standarisation, scale up activities while building momentum. 

*Typical Digital Twin Studio stakeholders conversations now include: other pioneers, technical experts, data scientists in similar contexts outside the own organisation.*

### [ARENA](#H4):
The Arena is the place of implementation and field testing. This is where other stakeholder reside that would actually use, deploy and implement the DT in their primary processes. These are policy makers, urban planners, legal experts, ethics experts etc. The Arena is a place of experimentation and implementation, using the solution to solve real world challenges. The move towards the Arena space is a critical step. If the Arena stakeholders were not involved in the Lab or Studio space, implementation might be hampered or fail to take-off. These stakeholders might find crucial elements missing in the emerging DT to be able to blend it in their primary process, for all kind of reasons: functionality, applicability, safety, legal concerns, ethical concerns etc. If these concerns prove to be hard to remedy based on choices made in Lab or Studio, a DT might well not succeed. 

*Typical Digital Twin Studio stakeholders conversations now include: urban planners, policy makers, legal experts, ethical experts, project managers etc.*

### [AGORA](#H5):
The Arena is the place of implementation and upscaling. This is where stakeholders reside that come from outside the organisation hosting the DT. Where the Arena is the place where a DT is used for internal purposes (support of urban planning decision making among professionals), the Agora is the place where public institutions, NGO’s, companies and indivuals (citizens) are getting involved in the decision making. The Agora is a place of exploitation and upscaling using the solution to solve real world challenges in co-creation with external participation. The move towards the Agora space is again a critical step. If the Agora stalkeholders were not involved in the other spaces, implementation might again be hampered or fail to take-off, since these stakeholders have different requirements, demands and abilities than the professionals in the Arena. These stakeholders might find crucial elements missing in the emerging DT to be able to participate from their own perspective. If these concerns prove to be hard to remedy based on choices made in Lab, Studio or Arena, a DT might well not succeed in this place. 

*Typical Digital Twin Studio stakeholders conversations now include: external organisations, NGO’s, citizens, companies.*
