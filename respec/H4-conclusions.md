# Conclusions, recommendations, next steps

Within the scope of the project a questionnaire has been filled out by each participant. From a technology perspective this shows that organisations are using a broad range of technologies, ranging from commercial platforms to open source components and from large cloud vendors to stand alone software packages.

In a way these results underline the best practices we are promoting in this report. There is not one ideal solution for all organisations to use. It all depends on the scale of the organisation, the IT landscape it is operating in and the specific requirements for use cases. What we are promoting is the use of open standards and well defined building blocks to create an interoperable system. The value of an LDT comes often from combining different datasources from (possibly) different systems to provide a holistic insight into the policy question at hand.

For all organisations this means you want to be able to create datasources that can be used in multiple platforms. For example if an environmental research institute carries out a study you want the results not only in PDF and not only in a bespoke interactive viewer provided by the research institute, but you want the results in such a format that you can integrate them in the visualisation tool of choice within the organisation. Or you want to be able to feed those results into another model to create a combined insight from different sources.

As is already outlined in [2.1 Scope and approach](./H2-approach.md#scope-and-approach) there is not just one digital twin. Depending on the use case and policy step a unique set of building blocks is selected to realize a LDT to provide the necessary insight.

The Capabilities map shown here shows the different capabilities that might come into play in the different use cases. These capabilities are also addressed in the studio situation to gain insights in the required capability for the challenge at hand. Depending on the evolution within the project there might be a situation where a capability like 'find and bind' is already in a agora situation, while for the specific use case at hand a 'simulation' capability is in a lab situation.

How you can develop LDT solutions within the context of the organisation largely depends on the IT governance of the organisation. Some organisations might follow the ['bi-modal' technology pattern](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/bimodal), while others have a specific open source policy. A technology stack can never be developed 'in isolation', you'll need to align with the IT governance in the organisation, as well as the Governance framework, the Ethics, Inclusion and democratization framework and the Education and training framework of this project.
