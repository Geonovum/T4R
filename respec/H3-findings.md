# Main findings

## Lab questions

The lab phase starts with the basic, fundamental questions. Why do I want a DT and to which guardrails and principles should the LDT adhere?

1. How do we avoid lock-ins?

2. How do we make sure our solution is re-usable?

3. How do we make sure our solution is interoperable with other organisations?

4. How do we create insights that are interpretable and well balanced?

5. How can we create results in the short term, while staying relevant towards the future?


### Best practices

- Use Open International Standards.

    Open standards are a way to enable systems to be interoperable and to avoid lock-in.

- 'The web is the operating system'

    Modern architectures operate on a web-scale and can work in a distributed environment.

- Driven by and from use-case

    Even from technical framework viewpoint, a socio-technical approach should be expected. 

- Work with the best that is available today (affordable, reliable, scalable & resilient)

    



## Studio questions

The studio phase focusses on the capabilities. Which building blocks do we need to define.

1. Which capabilities do we need to find, operate and interrogate our data sources?

2. Which capabilities do we need to combine, validate and verify our data sources?

3. Which capabilities do we need to gain insights from our data sources?

4. Which capabilities do we need to make sure we can trust the insights we get from our data sources?

5. How do we communicate our insights to our stakeholders?


### Best practices

- Thinking in terms of capabilities or functions enables you to compare different building blocks or 
solutions from vendors. In that way it facilitates working towards value creation, rather than solution adoption.


## Arena questions

The Arena phase is all about the questions regarding the actual implementation of capabilities in applications and processes.

1. What kind of visualisation interface do I need to communicate my insights to the users? 
Does it need to be a 3D viewer, or is a 2D or a chart sufficient?

2. How does my data storage landscape look like? 
Which tools do I need to provide the right dataservices to my models or visualisation tools.

3. How do I make sure my users can actually find the right datasources, models, dashboards?
What type of catalogue do I need, how proficient are my users in searching and finding products.

4. How do I make sure the different components in my landscape can actually 'talk' to eachother?

5. Which systems do I need to have in place to support my data governance processes?
Make sure your technical system aligns with the operating model of your organisation.

### Best practices

- Components are containerable, developer friendly.
Think in terms of current (cloud) technology practices. Disposability of components, cattle vs pets.

- Components (Products) are loosely bound and talk to each other over APIâ€™s.
Design your systems decoupled. That is not to say, data and visualisation should always be 'physically' separated.

- Avoid pre-optimalisation
In this fast moving innovative world it is sometimes tempting to do too much in terms of optimalisation for future possible functionality.
Be aware that innovation is unpredictable a try to built 'just enough'.

## Agora questions

The Agora phase is focussing on the implementation and deployment of LDT's in production. Focussing on wider use, stability, trustworhyness etc.

1. How do I want my deployments to be rolled out to users?

2. Do I need tutorial systems like disposable environments to educate my users?
Do I have a centralized system, what does my application environment and management thereof look like?

3. What type of Service Level Agreements (SLA's) do I have internally and externally? 
What type of availability is actually necessary, what about backup/restore.

4. Do I have the rigt security frameworks in place?
Both in terms of GDPR (privacy) and NIS2 (cybersecurity)

5. Do I have observability in place to monitor my systems in terms of cost, incidents, performance etc.?
