## Studio questions

The studio situation focusses on the capabilities of a Digital Twin. Which building blocks do we need to define.

Main capabilities mapped to the Digital Twin Capabilities Periodic Table

<aside class="note">
By Capability in this context we mean the ability to achieve a desired outcome in terms of functionalities of a Digital Twin.

We use this approach to help focus on the requirements, rather than technical solutions that might be provided by solution providers. 
</aside>
These capabilities are based on prior work Geonovum has done: [[NLDT_PP_BB]] In this report we try to bridge the gap between technical solutions as described in the [Digital Twin Capabilities Periodic Table](https://www.digitaltwinconsortium.org/initiatives/capabilities-periodic-table/) and the context from which policy makers are operating, often a plan-do-check-act cycle of spatial planning.

### Which capabilities do we need to find, operate and interrogate our data sources?

__Best practices__

- Have a Datacentric mind, rather than a software centric mind. 
- Have FAIR (Findable, Accesible, Interoperable, Re-usable) principles in mind.

### Which capabilities do we need to combine, validate and verify our data sources?

__Best practices__

- Well defined, clearly scoped interfaces help with the interoperability between components.


### Which capabilities do we need to gain insights from our data sources?

__Best practices__

- Thinking in terms of capabilities or functions enables you to compare different building blocks or solutions from vendors. In that way it facilitates working towards value creation, rather than solution adoption.

### Which capabilities do we need to make sure we can trust the insights we get from our data sources?

__Best practices__

- Reach out to policy makers, make sure the results from a DT a relateable to the policies they are supposed to make understandable.

### How do we communicate our insights to our stakeholders?

__Best practices__

- Understand your stakeholder needs. The experience needs to be useful for the target audience.

### How do we manage the complexity of a solution and make sure we can 'mix and match' different building blocks?

__Best practices__

- The architecture we promote is composed of different building blocks:
    - Data
    - Processing
    - Visualisation
    - Foundation

By splitting the system in different building blocks (which are based on standards and interoperable interfaces) we make sure the system is flexible. We can use for example different visualisation solutions with a processing backend, and we can upgrade certain parts without needing to upgrade the complete system.

__Lessons Learned__
Critical succesfactors comprise of concrete, understandable building blocks. By adopting an agile mindset a roadmap can be realized in smaller steps which deliver value in their own rights.

An area that needs further research revolves around quantifiable key performance indicators that are comparable accross different organisations.
