# Approach

## Scope and approach 

This report is building from existing work. Most notable the 'Policy processes and building blocks for Digital Twins' [[NLDT_PP_BB]] report.

Based on the knowledge and insights from this earlier work we propose an initial structure with relevant questions. 
This initial framework is then discussed with the various stakeholders in workshops. Feedback is incorporated in the final result.

1. Foundation, Data, Visualization, Processes - this is an evolution of a pattern that was raised in the [DUET](https://www.digitalurbantwins.com/) project and proved to be effective for both technical use and organisational use. The evolutive part is the explicit addition of the Foundation element (in DUET this was implicit) and that defines the elements that are needed to bring the other 3 in the same reference frame. These include IAM, Catalogus, Metadata, etc.

2. The Policy and Digital Twins [[NLDT_PP_BB]] study indicates that the relationship between Policy and Digital Twins is to be found between Policy steps (Plan Do Act Check - [PDCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA#:~:text=PDCA%20or%20plan%E2%80%93do%E2%80%93check,or%20the%20control%20circle%2Fcycle.)) and Capabilities (aka Building Block) of the Digital Twin. Each Policy Step requires its own unique set of Capabilities depending on the Use Case. This means that for each policy step a unique Digital Twin is composed of Building Blocks. To be interoperable, every building blocks defines its own set of standards or best practices.

## A joint structure for the Frameworks’ findings 

In collaboration with the other frameworks a joint structure was developed as outlined below.

### THE LAB-STUDIO-ARENA-AGORA MODEL

#### LAB
The Lab is the place of experimentation and pioneering. Most innovations start in a Lab situation. The Lab is a place of experimentation and exploration. In this place crucial decisions have to be made, some of which can not easily be changed at a later stage of deployment. Mistakes made in the Lab can have far reaching consequences further along the way. One of the most common mistakes in this place is postponing exposure to other stakeholders outside the Lab place in the early stages. 

*Typical Digital Twin Lab stakeholder conversations: among pioneers, technical experts, data scientists.*

#### STUDIO
The Studio is the place of experimentation and pioneering where pioneers meet and exchange early progress, ideas and solutions. The Studio is a place of experimentation and exploration, but teaming up with others to accumulate lessons learned, discuss standards, adopt best practises from each Lab etc. If projects move from the Lab to the Studio space and mistakes have been made in each Lab in consulting other stakeholders outside the Lab place, complexities arise since the Studio place usually accelerates innovations towards standarisation, scale up activities while building momentum. 

*Typical Digital Twin Studio stakeholders conversations now include: other pioneers, technical experts, data scientists in similar contexts outside the own organisation.*

#### ARENA
The Arena is the place of implementation and field testing. This is where other stakeholder reside that would actually use, deploy and implement the DT in their primary processes. These are policy makers, urban planners, legal experts, ethics experts etc. The Arena is a place of experimentation and implementation, using the solution to solve real world challenges. The move towards the Arena space is a critical step. If the Arena stakeholders were not involved in the Lab or Studio space, implementation might be hampered or fail to take-off. These stakeholders might find crucial elements missing in the emerging DT to be able to blend it in their primary process, for all kind of reasons: functionality, applicability, safety, legal concerns, ethical concerns etc. If these concerns prove to be hard to remedy based on choices made in Lab or Studio, a DT might well not succeed. 

*Typical Digital Twin Studio stakeholders conversations now include: urban planners, policy makers, legal experts, ethical experts, project managers etc.*

#### AGORA
The Arena is the place of implementation and upscaling. This is where stakeholders reside that come from outside the organisation hosting the DT. Where the Arena is the place where a DT is used for internal purposes (support of urban planning decision making among professionals), the Agora is the place where public institutions, NGO’s, companies and indivuals (citizens) are getting involved in the decision making. The Agora is a place of exploitation and upscaling using the solution to solve real world challenges in co-creation with external participation. The move towards the Agora space is again a critical step. If the Agora stalkeholders were not involved in the other spaces, implementation might again be hampered or fail to take-off, since these stakeholders have different requirements, demands and abilities than the professionals in the Arena. These stakeholders might find crucial elements missing in the emerging DT to be able to participate from their own perspective. If these concerns prove to be hard to remedy based on choices made in Lab, Studio or Arena, a DT might well not succeed in this place. 

*Typical Digital Twin Studio stakeholders conversations now include: external organisations, NGO’s, citizens, companies.*

### THE IMPORTANCE OF CRITICAL QUESTIONS

The framework aims to bring together different stakeholders as to maximize the viewpoints to be addressed. 
Explicitly bringing together stakeholders who are further along the exploration path of the adoption of LDT's with organisations who are starting this journey helps gain insight into which questions prove to be quintessential, and which questions prove to be trivial.


### THE IMPORTANCE OF LESSONS LEARNED

The framework also aims to address 'lessons learned' from early adopters, so organisations embarking on a journey to implement LDT's can learn from the early adopters and hopefully implement those lessons more easily.

Following from the critical questions some best practices and lessons learned are also documented in the following chapter.
